Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Liam is the owner of DriverPass. DriverPass wants an application to allow driving students to practice exams, reserve driving times, and see all progress they have made

What did you do particularly well?
I did well creating the activity and sequence diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
In the Project 1 short paper, I would improve my model comparisons. I would improve it by describing how to help with budgeting and identifying the skill of developers. I would also provide the disadvantages of the object models.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
I first read over the original DriverPass transcript to understand what was needed to implement into the system design. It is very important to consider the user's needs so that the system is easy and enjoyable to use.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
To design software, you first need to have a clear understanding of your requirements. Then you can plan and visualize your design. Then slowly work into your design. In the future I would like to try and use the bottom-up desing when designing a system.
